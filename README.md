# Medical Examination Data Analysis

This project analyzes a medical examination dataset to detect health-related indicators such as overweight status, cholesterol and glucose levels. It also generates visualizations including categorical plots and heatmaps for correlation analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset (`medical_examination.csv`) contains medical data with fields such as:

- Height (cm)
- Weight (kg)
- Cholesterol level
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure readings
- Lifestyle indicators (smoking, alcohol intake, physical activity)
- Cardiovascular disease presence (target variable)

## Features

- Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) to classify overweight status.
- Normalizes cholesterol and glucose levels into binary variables.
- Draws categorical bar plots comparing different health variables across cardiovascular disease groups.
- Draws a heatmap of correlations after cleaning the dataset.
